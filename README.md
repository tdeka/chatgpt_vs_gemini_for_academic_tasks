# ChatGPT vs. Gemini: Academic User Experience Analysis

This project analyzes how students and academics experience two leading large language models (ChatGPT and Google Gemini) for academic tasks. Using Reddit data and comparative articles, I examined differences in user trust, satisfaction, pain points, sentiment, and overall experience across tasks like coding, research, writing, and studying.

## Research Goals

- Compare user trust and satisfaction across ChatGPT and Gemini for academic tasks

- Identify pain points and positive experiences influencing model preference

- Understand user archetypes (Technical Problem-Solver, Writer/Creator, Learner)

- Provide strategic recommendations for improving academic LLM UX

## Methodology

- Data collection: 46 user experience instances from Reddit (LLM-focused communities) and comparative articles

- Data preparation: Cleaning and structuring in Python (pandas)

## Analysis

- Trust & satisfaction coding

- Sentiment analysis with VADER NLP

- Thematic analysis for pain points & highlights

- Visualization: Matplotlib for task-level comparisons

## Key Findings

- ChatGPT: Higher trust & satisfaction for coding, reasoning, research; valued for study support

- Gemini: Stronger in data analysis, writing, summarization; users reported 56% more positive sentiment overall

- Pain points: ChatGPT → accuracy issues; Gemini → distributed frustrations (engagement, contextualization, task execution)

- Archetypes: Technical Problem-Solver, Writer/Creator, Learner

## Tools & Skills

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

- Natural Language Processing (VADER Sentiment Analysis)

- User Research & Thematic Analysis

- Data Visualization & Storytelling

- Strategic UX Recommendations
